                    <h3>UDP Server-Client Communication System</h3>
                    <p>In this project, Alfie developed a communication system using the UDP protocol, allowing the server and client to exchange data quickly. This project was challenging because UDP does not guarantee data packet integrity, so Alfie designed a solution to minimize data loss and ensure the system functioned efficiently in real-time situations. This project demonstrates expertise in networking and communication protocols within the realm of programming.</p>

                    <h3>Account Database for MachaaID Employee Participants</h3>
                    <p>Alfie was responsible for developing a database system using Django to store and manage participant accounts for MachaaID. Each account consisted of a username and password, and Alfie designed a secure authentication system to protect participant data. This project is a clear example of applying cybersecurity practices in web application development, ensuring sensitive information is safeguarded through proper access management.</p>
